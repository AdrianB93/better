#INFT3050: Web Programming

##Major Assignment

**BETTER: Battling Elemental Titans Through Exercise Routines.**

This is the major project for INFT3050 Web Programming at the University of Newcastle.

My group used the [RESTful routing](http://restfulrouting.com/) plugin available on NuGet for the MVC system.

During this project, the team and I showed great understanding in knowledge in web applicaions by using a RESTful MVC opposed to an n-tiered architecture the course was teaching. 

`This project landed me a role in developing an exercise web app for the University of Newcastle called` [NukkeIT](http://www.nukkeit.com/).
